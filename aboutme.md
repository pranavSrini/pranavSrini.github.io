Welcome to my page! My name is Pranav Srinivasan - I am a junior computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm interested in machine learning, full-stack software engineering, and quantitative finance. Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball and the classical guitar.

This page has all my experiences, projects, and research, as well as ways to contact me. Thanks for dropping by!
