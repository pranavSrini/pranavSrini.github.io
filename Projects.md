LonghornProtector                      
---							
Implemented a web-scraping tool that leveraged BeautifulSoup and SQLAlchemy to amalgamate UT crime data
Devised a recursive descent JSON parser in C to organize crime data;  Build a Vue.js front-end with TypeScript
Deployed to web using Heroku and Firebase; uploaded to cloud using AWS EC2 as a Kubernetes containerized application

---
LoanForecast										        
---
Developed a mobile app using WorldBank API to temporally forecast loan retention rates using a deep learning model.
Created a cross-platform frontend using React-Native, Expo, and Node.js; deploying to Google Play Store using Firebase.
Constructed an adapted LSTNet in Tensorflow for model; Employing Scikit-Learn RFE for feature ranking pre-training.

---
GeoGAN
---
Created a novel DCGAN to synthetically reconstruct scans of subsurface rocks in Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn and OpenCV. Reinforcing with Bayesian Search hyperparameter optimization; Architecting as a Docker Image and deploying to AWS EC2

---
Dermanostix
---
Created a computer vision web-app using Flask, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn to diagnose skin cancer real-time. Integrates a Haar-Cascade object classier with a ResNet, VGG16, and DenseNet161 ensemble for image analysis. Implemented a T-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm and confusion matrix for feature visualization post-development. Partnered with Baylor Scott & White Health, STEAMism, and the 1517 Fund for project demos, seed funding and expansion
